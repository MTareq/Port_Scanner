Port_Scanner
============

Establish socket connections to a range of ports.

Takes timeout args but its not used as inteded(at least not tested on other ips and ports).

Closing opened sockets while nested in the loop in got going well,
will try to divide the socket (testing) and (closing) into separate functions.

Adding CMD Module in the next revision.
