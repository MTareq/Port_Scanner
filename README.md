Started at 8:30 am finished at 10:00 am 29/8/2013

Takes timeout args but its not used as inteded(at least not tested on other ips and ports).

Closing opened sockets while nested in the loop in got going well,
will try to separate the socket testing and closing to separate functions.

Adding CMD Module in the next revision.
